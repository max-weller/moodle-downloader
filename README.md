# Moodle Downloader

## Origin
This is a fork from [davidgengenbach/moodle-downloader](https://github.com/davidgengenbach/moodle-downloader) that did not work on the Moodle platform from the [Hochschule Pforzheim University](https://www.hs-pforzheim.de/) due to differences in the html-structure.

For now only the Python version is fixed, not the web-version.

## Usage

This script is used to download (HS Pforzheim) Moodle Assets automatically.

There is a web-version you can execute inside the web browser (see `README.md` in the folder). You have to be logged-in for this version.

There is also a more comfortable version where you just have to execute a python script.
